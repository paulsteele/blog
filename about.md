I'm Paul Steele, a software engineer based out of the Indianapolis area. 
I'm currently interested in automation of all kinds, whether that be continuous integration pipelines, or home automation.
At the moment that involves interacting a lot with Kubernetes, Docker, and Jenkins. 
I strive to find and remove inefficiencies from processes to better provide value to the end user. 

Here I'll post the various thoughts that come to me from time to time, some related to technology and some just about life in general.
