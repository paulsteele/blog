I'm Paul Steele, a software engineer based out of the Indianapolis area. I'm currently interested in automation of all kinds, whether that be continuous integration pipelines, or home automation. 

Here I'll post the various thoughts that come to me from time to time, some related to technology and some just about life in general.
