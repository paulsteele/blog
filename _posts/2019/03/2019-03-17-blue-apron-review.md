I've been using [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com) for close to 8 months now. I've really enjoyed the service and feel like my ability to cook has increased a lot. I initially wanted to try the service so I could stockpile some recipes, but they kept me hooked with the quality of the meat delivered and the variety of menu options. I always feel like I'm trying something new. All of that is to say I thought it might be fun to start jotting down my thoughts about the meals they've sent now that I've experienced enough of them to have a proper opinion (UPDATE: a few weeks after writing this blog post, I ended up canceling my subscription. This was done for a variety of reasons, budget being one of the major ones. I may still end up writing some meal reviews as I remake some of the meals that I was sent in the past, but there won't be many new recipe reviews). Let's dive in.

# Bánh Mì-Style Beef Burgers
Essentially this meal was 2 burgers (2 patties a piece with a long baguette bun) with a carrot and radish topping. Served with roasted broccoli.
### Preparation: ★★★★☆
Preparing this dish was fairly simple. The roasted broccoli was just thrown in the oven seasoned with sesame oil and roasted for 10 minutes. Creating the dressing for the burgers involved chopping up a couple carrots and radishes and mixing them together. Additionally a sugar - vinegar mix was added in with the vegetables to finish it off. I messed up a little bit and combined the vinegar and sugar together and then poured into the vegetables when I should have done it the other way around to avoid a bunch of sugary residue. Splitting the ground beef into 4 patties instead of 2 really helped speed the cooking process along. Finally the baguettes were roasted along with the broccoli. Assembling everything was fairly straightforward, although a lot of the dressing did end up falling off the burger itself.
### Taste: ★★★☆☆
The thing I was most apprehensive about with this meal was the dressing itself, but it turned out to be the thing I most enjoyed. It really tied the whole meal together. Unfortunately I added too much spice mix to the meat so it ended up tasting not as good as it probably could have if I had used half the amount of seasoning. When roasting the baguettes, the instructions said to drizzle olive oil on them (as Blue Apron tends to recommend). I should have trusted my gut and avoided that because it made the bread super oily. The sesame oil was delicious combined with the broccoli.
### Meal Size: ★★★★★
The meal was filling. It was one of the few meals where I was actually full eating it after a day at the office and going for a run. I had plenty for lunch the next day too.

# Fontina-Smothered Chicken
Grilled chicken layered with cheese and sweet peppers served alongside mashed potatoes and roasted zucchini.
### Preparation: ★★★☆☆
On the description they describe the recipe as "easy", but there was a fair amount of setup involved. Chopping zucchini, garlic, peppers, and cheese and needing to keep them separate used up quite a few cutting boards. The mashed potatoes were simple enough to prepare (as they always are). Cooking the chicken required monitoring it until just the right time to add the cheese and peppers so they could melt on top. This might be easier for some, but I somehow always take longer cooking meats than the recipe anticipates so knowing when exactly to add the toppings was a bit of guess work. After the chicken was cooked, the same pan was used to cook the zucchini, which further compounded the "delay" that I had. By the end the mashed potatoes were cooler than I would have liked. Next time I would probably cook the zucchini in parallel with the rest of the meal.
### Taste: ★★★★☆
The chicken itself was excellent. Despite the guess work on it, the melted toppings turned out great. There was perhaps a bit too much cheese but my love of sweet peppers more than made up for it. I added a few too many red pepper flakes to the zucchini so those ended up being less than ideal. The mashed potatoes pulled the whole meal together.
### Meal Size: ★★★★☆
The portion size on this meal was good. I wasn't hungry enough after the first serving that I wanted anymore, so I was able to get another meal out of it the next day.

# Smoky Chicken & Aioli
Rice, kale, and grilled chicken. What more could a man want?
### Preparation: ★★★★★
The prep for this was super simple. Cooking the rice and kale was as easy as putting it in the pot and forgetting. This was the first time that I had used saffron in a meal, and I was definitely surprised at how little of it caused the rice to dye such a shade of yellow. The chicken was easy to prepare, just blend with a spice rub and let sit cooking in the pan. Along the way adding some olives and some water. Having the chicken all cut up definitely helped the preparation time. Once everything was cooked, it was just mixing everything together and serving!
### Taste: ★★★★☆
The spice blend that was on the chicken was amazing. I'm definitely going to have to use that again when preparing chicken. The kale and rice were good as well, but there was something that felt a tad off while eating it. My suspicion is that it was the saffron and I just wasn't used to it, but next time I might elect to use less of the saffron and see how things fare.
### Meal Size: ★★★★★
This meal was also incredibly filling. I shouldn't be surprised as the meals with rice almost always tend to be that way. The oddity with the taste was definitely more prevalent while eating the leftovers however.
