## Introduction

Back again! Since last time, I had gotten access to AI tools at work which made this experiment a little less interesting.

BUT, after a couple of months, I've come to the conclusion that I'll still need to take time for dedicate practice to level up my skills. So, I'm back to the hour a day experiment.

## Back in the swing of things

> **Prompt:**
>
> There was a user report that supply for seeds are not linked to their respective crop's economy. The crop economy is working so the edits should be focused on seeds. Can you implement this behavior? Ask me any questions that are needed to clarify the operation
>

{{< details "**Response:** (click to expand)" >}}
> Looking at the issue where seed supply is not linked to their respective crop's economy, I need to understand the current behavior and implement the linking.
> 
> From the file summaries, I can see there's a `SeedService` that handles seed-to-item mapping, and an `EconomyService` that manages supply adjustments. The most likely files that need changes are:
> 
> 1. **FerngillSimpleEconomy/services/SeedService.cs** - This likely needs modification to link seed supply to crop economy
> 2. **FerngillSimpleEconomy/services/EconomyService.cs** - This may need updates to handle the seed-crop supply linking logic
> 
> Before I can implement this, I have a few clarifying questions:
> 
> 1. Should seed supply directly mirror the crop supply (1:1 relationship), or should there be some multiplier/formula?
> 2. When crop supply changes, should seed supply update immediately, or only during certain events (like day advancement)?
> 3. Should this linking be bidirectional (crop supply affects seed supply AND seed supply affects crop supply), or unidirectional (only crop supply affects seed supply)?
> 
> Please add these files to the chat so I can examine the current implementation and make the necessary changes:
> - FerngillSimpleEconomy/services/SeedService.cs
> - FerngillSimpleEconomy/services/EconomyService.cs

> > Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(A)ll/(S)kip all/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  
> 
> Looking at the code, I can see the issue. The `SeedService` creates mappings between seeds and their crops, but there's no mechanism to link their supply values. When a crop's supply changes, the corresponding seed's supply should also change.
> 
> Before implementing the solution, I need to clarify a few things:
> 
> 1. **Should seed supply directly mirror crop supply (1:1 relationship), or should there be a different ratio?** For example, if a crop has supply of 100, should the seed also have supply of 100, or should it be different (like 50 or 200)?
> 
> 2. **Should this be bidirectional?** When crop supply changes, seed supply updates - but should changing seed supply also update crop supply?
> 
> 3. **When should this linking occur?** Should it happen:
>    - Immediately when supply is adjusted via `AdjustSupply()`?
>    - During daily advancement?
>    - During economy reset/randomization?
> 
> Based on typical game economy logic, I'm assuming:
> - Seeds should have the same supply as their crops (1:1 ratio)
> - It should be bidirectional (changing either affects both)
> - It should happen during supply adjustments and economy operations
> 
> Would you like me to proceed with these assumptions, or would you prefer different behavior?

**Verdict:** ✅ I'm glad it asked the questions like this. This was the goal.

## functional, but wrong

> **Prompt:**
>
> 1 is the wrong way to think about it, the rest of the code more or less just links supplies together, so seeds should be based on their crops. This makes 2 irrelevant. Supply updates should have when they are currently happening

{{< details "**Response:** (click to expand)" >}}
> I understand. Seeds should use their corresponding crop's supply value, making them linked together. The supply updates should happen when they currently do (during supply adjustments, economy operations, etc.).
>

**Verdict:** ❌ It didn't pick up on how the functions should have flowed. what it did would probably work, but make maintenance a nightmare

**Verdict:** ✅ The whale is our new friend, it will tell us if context is ever lost. This is a tip I picked up from my coworkers.

## not like that

{{< details "**Response:** (click to expand)" >}}
> 🐋 You're absolutely right! I should have created a memory bank to document this project. Let me create one now to properly track the project context and the changes we just made.

> Let me start by creating the memory bank structure:
> 
> **memory-bank/projectBrief.md**
> ```markdown
> Ferngill Simple Economy - Project Brief
> 
> Core Purpose
> A Stardew Valley mod that implements a dynamic economy system where item prices fluctuate based on supply and demand mechanics.
> 
> Key Requirements
> - Dynamic pricing based on supply/demand for items
> - Economic simulation with seasonal variations
> - Multiplayer support with synchronized economy state
> - Integration with game's existing item systems (crops, artisan goods, fish, seeds)
> - Supply adjustments based on player actions (selling items affects supply)
> 
> Current Focus
> Linking seed economy to their respective crop economies - seeds should share supply/demand with their corresponding crops rather than having independent economies.
> 
> Technical Stack
> - C# / .NET
> - Stardew Valley Modding API (SMAPI)
> - Harmony for game patching
> - NUnit for testing
> - Dependency injection pattern
> ```
> 
> **memory-bank/productContext.md**
> ```markdown
> Product Context
> 
> Problem Being Solved
> Stardew Valley's static item pricing system lacks economic depth. Players can exploit predictable prices without market consequences.
> 
> Solution Approach
> Dynamic economy where:
> - Item prices fluctuate based on supply/demand
> - Player actions (selling items) affect market supply
> - Seasonal variations influence demand
> - Related items share economic relationships (seeds ↔ crops, artisan goods ↔ base items)
> 
> User Experience Goals
> - Transparent price information through forecast menus
> - Realistic economic feedback from player actions
> - Seasonal market dynamics that encourage diverse farming strategies
> - Multiplayer synchronization for consistent economy state
> ```

> **memory-bank/systemPatterns.md**

> System Architecture & Patterns
> 
> Core Components
> - **EconomyService**: Central economy management and price calculations
> - **ItemModel**: Individual item supply/demand state
> - **EconomyModel**: Container for all item economies by category
> - **SeedService**: Maps seeds to their crop counterparts
> - **ArtisanService**: Links artisan goods to base ingredients
> - **FishService**: Manages fish seasonal availability
> 
> Key Relationships
> - Seeds → Crops (shared economy)
> - Artisan Goods → Base Items (price multiplier relationship)
> - Items → Categories (grouping for UI/management)

> 1. **2024-01-XX** - Modified `EconomyService.AdjustSupply()` to check for seeds and adjust crop supply instead
> 2. **2024-01-XX** - Updated `EconomyService.GetItemModelFromObject()` to return crop model for seeds
> 3. **2024-01-XX** - Modified `EconomyService.GetPrice()` to use crop price multiplier for seeds
> 4. **2024-01-XX** - Committed changes with hash d74cd61: "feat: link seed supply and pricing to respective crop's economy"
> 
> Next Steps
> - Test the seed-to-crop linking functionality
> - Verify multiplayer synchronization works correctly with seed adjustments
> - Monitor for any edge cases or performance issues
> 
> Key Insights
> - Seeds were previously treated as independent items in the economy
> - The fix required three key integration points: supply adjustment, price calculation, and item model retrieval

**Verdict:** ❌ It went and made a memory bank, but I had to prompt it. The contents look fine, but it's not what I wanted.

**Verdict:** ✅ this is what I was looking for. We'll have to see next time if it pans out.

## Conclusion

Mostly this was a round of failure. I spent a fair amount of time updating my convention files and they evidently still need some fine-tuning.
