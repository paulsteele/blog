Today is going to be a little different as my "hour" of ai was over a brownbag during lunch. Multiple people from work shared success and failure stories from their own personal ai adventures.

Mostly the things they said were things that were on my radar but it was good to hear some new ideas too. I'm planning on trying out some of those learnings into this series as well.

Until tomorrow!ðŸ‘‹
