I'm running off not much sleep as a bunch of severe weather came through my neighborhood last night. I have an event to go to in a few, and I'm not sure if I'll be up for a full session when I return. So in the off chance I'm not a co-worker posted an insightful article, that while I may not totally agree with, is an interesting perspective on ai tooling.
