Feeling better this morning so let's finally get rid of these test flakes!

## Better!

> Looking at the `ShouldDrawRow` test case and the `ForecastMenu` implementation, I can identify a few potential reasons why the test with 2 expected rows is only drawing one:
> 
> Potential Issues:
> 
> 1. **Screen Height Calculation Issue**:
>    In the test, you're setting `Game1.uiViewport.Height = 620 * expectedRows;` to try to accommodate multiple rows. However, in the `SetupPositionAndSize` method of `ForecastMenu`, the height is calculated as:
>    ```csharp
>    height = Math.Min(Game1.uiViewport.Height - 2 * yPadding, 2000);
>    ```
>    And then the number of rows is calculated as:
>    ```csharp
>    _maxNumberOfRows = (height - 355) / 120;
>    ```
>    The height might be getting capped at 2000, or the calculation might not be properly accounting for the increased viewport height.
> 
> 2. **Verification Issue in the Test**:
>    The test is verifying drawing calls for the first row in detail, but it's only checking for the existence of the second row with:
>    ```csharp
>    _drawTextHelperMock.Verify(m => m.DrawAlignedText(...), Times.Exactly(expectedRows > 1 ? 1 : 0))
>    ```
>    It's possible the second row is being drawn but not properly verified.
> 
> 3. **Row Drawing Logic**:
>    In the `draw` method of `ForecastMenu`, rows are drawn with:
>    ```csharp
>    for (var i = 0; i < _maxNumberOfRows; i++)
>    {
>        if (_itemIndex + i < _allItems.Length)
>        {
>            DrawRow(batch, _allItems[_itemIndex + i], i, xPositionOnScreen, yPositionOnScreen, width);
>        }
>    }
>    ```
>    If `_maxNumberOfRows` is not being calculated correctly based on the test setup, it might only be drawing one row.
> 
> 4. **Horizontal Partition Drawing**:
>    The test is checking:
>    ```csharp
>    Assert.That(HarmonyIClickableMenu.DrawHoriztonalPartitionCalls[_batch], Has.Count.EqualTo(1 + expectedRows));
>    ```
>    But the horizontal partitions might not be drawn correctly for multiple rows.
> 
> 5. **Y-coordinate Calculation for Second Row**:
>    In the `DrawRow` method, the y-coordinate for each row is calculated as:
>    ```csharp
>    var y = startingY + 315 + padding + (rowHeight + padding) * rowNumber;
>    ```
>    There might be an issue with how this calculation works for multiple rows, especially if other UI elements are taking up space.
> 
> Recommendations:
> 
> 1. Add more detailed assertions to verify the second row is being drawn correctly, including checking the y-coordinates of the drawn elements.
> 
> 2. Debug the `_maxNumberOfRows` calculation to ensure it's correctly accounting for the increased viewport height.
> 
> 3. Check if the `DrawRow` method is being called twice when expected by adding a counter or mock verification.
> 
> 4. Verify that the y-coordinate calculation for the second row is placing it in a visible area of the screen.
> 
> 5. Consider adding a direct test for the `SetupPositionAndSize` method to ensure it's calculating dimensions correctly based on the viewport size.

> Analysis of NullReferenceException in EconomyServiceTests
> 
> Looking at the error, it appears there's a NullReferenceException occurring during the initialization of a `Farmer` object in your test setup. The error happens when `Game1.currentLocation` is accessed, which is null at that point.
> 
> Possible Causes
> 
> 1. **Harmony Mock Initialization Issue**: Your initial suspicion might be correct. The Harmony mocks for `Game1` or related classes might not be properly set up before the `Farmer` constructor is called.
> 
> 2. **Missing Mock for Game1.currentLocation**: The error specifically mentions `Game1.get_currentLocation()` is causing a null reference. You might need to add a mock for this property.
> 
> 3. **Order of Mock Setup**: The order in which mocks are initialized might be causing issues. The `Farmer` constructor might be accessing `Game1.currentLocation` before it's mocked.
> 
> 4. **Incomplete Farmer Mock**: Your `HarmonyFarmer.MockConstructor` method returns `false`, which should prevent the original constructor from running, but there might be other initialization code that's still executing.
> 
> 5. **Race Condition**: Since you mentioned it happens randomly, there might be a race condition in the test setup.
> 
> Proposed Solutions
> 
> Solution 1: Add Mock for Game1.currentLocation
> Add a mock for `Game1.currentLocation` in your `HarmonyGame` class:
> 
> ```csharp
> public static GameLocation CurrentLocationResult { get; set; }
> 
> static bool MockGetCurrentLocation(ref GameLocation __result)
> {
>     __result = CurrentLocationResult ?? new GameLocation();
>     return false;
> }
> 
> // In Setup method
> harmony.Patch(
>     AccessTools.PropertyGetter(typeof(Game1), nameof(Game1.currentLocation)),
>     prefix: new HarmonyMethod(typeof(HarmonyGame), nameof(MockGetCurrentLocation))
> );
> ```
> 
> Then in your test setup:
> ```csharp
> HarmonyGame.CurrentLocationResult = new GameLocation();
> ```
> 
> Solution 2: Ensure Proper Mock Initialization Order
> 
> Make sure the `HarmonyTestBase.Setup()` is called before any `Farmer` objects are created. You're calling `base.Setup()` at the beginning of your test setup, but verify that it's actually initializing all the necessary mocks.
> 
> Solution 3: Mock Game1.getLocationFromName Method
> 
> Since the error occurs in a call to `getLocationFromName`, you could mock this method directly:
> 
> ```csharp
> static bool MockGetLocationFromName(string name, bool isStructure, ref GameLocation __result)
> {
>     __result = new GameLocation();
>     return false;
> }
> 
> // In Setup method
> harmony.Patch(
>     AccessTools.Method(typeof(Game1), nameof(Game1.getLocationFromName), new[] { typeof(string), typeof(bool) }),
>     prefix: new HarmonyMethod(typeof(HarmonyGame), nameof(MockGetLocationFromName))
> );
> ```
> 
> Solution 4: Enhance Farmer Mock to Handle Initialization
> 
> Modify your `HarmonyFarmer` class to better handle the initialization process:
> 
> ```csharp
> static bool MockFarmerInit()
> {
>     return false; // Skip the original initialization
> }
> 
> // In Setup method
> harmony.Patch(
>     AccessTools.Method(typeof(Farmer), nameof(Farmer.farmerInit)),
>     prefix: new HarmonyMethod(typeof(HarmonyFarmer), nameof(MockFarmerInit))
> );
> ```
> 
> Solution 5: Pre-initialize Required Dictionaries
> 
> Ensure all dictionaries in `HarmonyFarmer` are initialized with the `Farmer` instance before it's used:
> 
> ```csharp
> // In your test setup
> _player = new Farmer();
> HarmonyFarmer.UniqueMultiplayerIdDictionary[_player] = 1;
> HarmonyFarmer.IsMainPlayerDictionary[_player] = true;
> HarmonyFarmer.FarmerTeamDictionary[_player] = new FarmerTeam();
> ```
> 
> Implementation Plan
> 
> 1. Start by implementing Solution 1 (mock for `Game1.currentLocation`) as it directly addresses the error.
> 2. If that doesn't resolve the issue, try Solution 3 (mock for `getLocationFromName`).
> 3. If the issue persists, implement Solution 4 to better handle the Farmer initialization.
> 4. Ensure Solution 5 is in place to prevent dictionary-related errors.
> 5. Review the order of operations in your test setup to ensure mocks are initialized before they're needed.
> 
> This approach should help identify and resolve the root cause of the intermittent NullReferenceException.

**Verdict:** ❌ This didn't get to the root of the issue (which was I was initializing my harmony mocks in a Setup not a OneTimeSetup

## Conclusion

Most of today was spent *not* using the ai as it didn't have a great grasp of how all the tests + code was working. To be fair the forecast menu is definitely a monstrosity of unclear drawing functions. Next up will be increasing test coverage as there are new feature requests that I'd like to implement.
