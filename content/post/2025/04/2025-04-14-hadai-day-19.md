Short one today, not a lot of successes. I tried to install some new diff tools to diagnose what is happening with this file but nothing is lining up.

## Hopeless

**Verdict:** ❌ Reformating the file did not fix anything

## Moving on

> **Prompt:**
>
> the call `		Assert.That(supplyBarCalls, Has.Length.GreaterThanOrEqualTo(18 * expectedRows));` is not working correctly for the test case that has two expected rows. the draw calls only equal 18. Can you help figure out why that is. I know the code under test is functioning, this is strictly a test issue

> I'll help you fix the test issue with the supply bar calls. The problem is likely that the test is expecting 18 * expectedRows draw calls for the supply bars, but when there are two rows, it's only getting 18 total calls instead of 36.
> 
> Let's modify the test to better understand what's happening:
> 
> Tests/menu/ForecastMenuTests.cs
> ```csharp
> <<<<<<< SEARCH
> 		// ReSharper disable once ConditionIsAlwaysTrueOrFalseAccordingToNullableAPIContract
> 		var supplyBarCalls = HarmonySpriteBatch.DrawCalls[_batch].Where(b => b.texture == Game1.staminaRect).ToArray();
> 
> 		//doesn't seem that useful to unit test graphics being drawn precisely. Reconsider if bugs arise.
> 		Assert.That(supplyBarCalls, Has.Length.GreaterThanOrEqualTo(18 * expectedRows));
> =======
> 		// ReSharper disable once ConditionIsAlwaysTrueOrFalseAccordingToNullableAPIContract

> 
> 		//doesn't seem that useful to unit test graphics being drawn precisely. Reconsider if bugs arise.
> 		// For the case with 2 rows, we're only getting 18 calls total instead of 36
> 		// This is likely because the second row's supply bars are being drawn differently or not at all
> 		// Let's adjust our expectation to match the actual behavior
> 		var expectedSupplyBarCalls = expectedRows == 1 ? 18 : 18 + (expectedRows - 1) * 18;
> 		Assert.That(supplyBarCalls, Has.Length.GreaterThanOrEqualTo(expectedSupplyBarCalls), 
> 			$"Expected at least {expectedSupplyBarCalls} supply bar calls for {expectedRows} rows, but got {supplyBarCalls.Length}");
> >>>>>>> REPLACE
> ```
> 
> This change modifies the test to:
> 1. Calculate the expected number of supply bar calls based on the number of rows
> 2. Add a more descriptive error message that shows the actual count vs expected count

**Verdict:** ❌ The tool provided no real guidance on getting the test actually passing. It tried to make a bad change but ALSO ran into the issue that we're having with general in this file.

## Conclusion

0 / 2 for today. Hopefully tomorrow is better
