Sorry to anybody who has actually been keeping up. I realized just before getting started for today that CI hadn't been run automatically the last two days. (I swear I was keeping up! Check out my github!)

In attempting to fix things I did ask claude some k8s command line questions, but they didn't get the syntax for deleting argo workloads just right, so I gave up and did things manually.

Ultimately the issue was really small: [Github made a change](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-07-changes-to-the-repository-object-in-push-webhook/) to how their webhooks were formatted which broke my Argo logic, but it did take up my hour for today. See you tomorrow.
