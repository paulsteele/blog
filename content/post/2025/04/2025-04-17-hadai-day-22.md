Stepping aside from my Stardew mod testing shenanigans. The blog parser needs a small update to remove markdown headers from aider's /ask sections as those get interpreted incorrectly by hugo

## Just do the thing

{{< details "**Response:** (click to expand)" >}}

**Verdict:** ❌ This both wouldn't work with leading whitespace, nor is it exactly formed how I would like.

## Too complicated

{{< details "**Response:** (click to expand)" >}}

**Verdict:** ❌ This might have worked, but it again was too complicated.

**Verdict:** ❌ While this might be what I asked, it still doesn't feel optimal. I'm willing to concede this was my fault.

## Trying to help

**Verdict:** ❌ Same as last time, I tried getting more specific, but my idea looked really bad in practice. Vetoed

## Finally

>    - Any leading whitespace, captured in group 1 (`(\s*)`)
>    - One or more # characters (`#+`)
>    - Any whitespace after the # characters (`\s*`)
> 3. Replaces the entire match with just the captured whitespace (`$1`)
> 4. Preserves the original indentation while removing all # characters and any whitespace after them

**Verdict:** ✅ This was ideally the level of complexity I was looking for.

**Verdict:** ✅ I specifically made the prompt to test whether it could figure out the expected output from the new test input without being told. It did a good job!

**Verdict:** ❌ I flew too close to the sun with this one. I'd rather keep the test the way it was.

## Conclusion

A nice diversion! This had an emergent nice workflow where I could pseudo prototype out ideas and pick from my favorite looking implementation. I'd like if I could reduce all ai interactions into a workflow similar to this one.
