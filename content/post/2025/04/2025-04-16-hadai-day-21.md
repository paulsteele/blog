An abnormal post today: I spent my hour looking over [Rider 2025.1's new ai integration](https://www.jetbrains.com/ai-assistant/). Unfortunately, after much searching I did not see any options to hook it into open router. The ollama option is definitely interesting, and might be something I try out in the near future. For now aider will still be my tool of choice :)
