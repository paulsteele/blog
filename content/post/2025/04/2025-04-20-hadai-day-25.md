I've spent a lot of time this weekend refactoring the Stardew mod. One of the big changes was making certain models require passing a field in via the constructor instead of as a property. That involves a lot of manual fixing. Let's see if the ai can do it :)

## Json Serialization Question

The whole reason I had done what I did originally was to satisfy json serialization. If that goes away things can be a lot simpler.

> JSON Serialization with System.Text.Json for Constructor-Initialized Properties
> 
> To properly serialize and deserialize a property that's set through a constructor but read through a property using System.Text.Json, you have a few options:
> 
> Option 1: Use a parameterized constructor with [JsonConstructor]
> 
> ```csharp
> using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
> 
> public class Person
> {
>     private readonly string _name;
> 
>     [JsonConstructor]
>     public Person(string name)
>     {
>         _name = name;
>     }
> 
>     public string Name => _name;
> }
> ```
> 
> The `[JsonConstructor]` attribute tells the serializer which constructor to use during deserialization.
> 
> Option 2: Use init-only properties
> 
> ```csharp
> public class Person
> {
>     public string Name { get; init; }
> }
> ```
> 
> This is a more modern approach in C# 9+. The `init` accessor allows the property to be set only during object initialization.
> 
> Option 3: Use a private setter
> 
> ```csharp
> public class Person
> {
>     public string Name { get; private set; }
> 
>     public Person(string name)
>     {
>         Name = name;
>     }
> 
>     // Parameterless constructor for deserialization
>     public Person() { }
> }
> ```
> 
> System.Text.Json can access private setters during deserialization.
> 
> Option 4: Use JsonInclude attribute for backing field
> 
> ```csharp
> public class Person
> {
>     [JsonInclude]
>     private readonly string _name;
> 
>     public Person(string name)
>     {
>         _name = name;
>     }
> 
>     public string Name => _name;
> }
> ```
> 
> The `[JsonInclude]` attribute tells the serializer to include the private field in serialization.
> 
> Option 5: Create a custom converter
> 
> For more complex scenarios, you can create a custom `JsonConverter<T>` to handle the serialization and deserialization logic yourself.
> 
> Choose the approach that best fits your design requirements and coding style.

**Verdict:** ✅ It didn't make the change for me, but it's answer did what I wanted to do.

## Run the tests to get context.

> **Prompt:**
>
> run the unit tests

{{< details "**Response:** (click to expand)" >}}
> To run the unit tests in your project, I need to suggest the appropriate command. Based on the file structure and the presence of test files in the Tests directory, it appears you're using a .NET project with NUnit for testing.
> 
> ```bash
> dotnet test
> ```
> 
> This command will run all the unit tests in your project. If you want to run specific tests or get more detailed output, you can add additional parameters to the command.

**Verdict:** ✅ As we'll see in the next prompt, this achieved the desired result

## Automate the manual work

> **Prompt:**
>
> for every file that has an error, please fix the errors by replacing the construction of ItemModels with a property initializer of the ObjectId to instead have that same value in the constructor. Leave all the other property initializers
>

{{< details "**Response:** (click to expand)" >}}
> Based on the error messages, I need to fix the ItemModel constructor calls in several test files. I'll need to see the actual content of these files to make the correct changes. Could you please add the following files to the chat:
> 
> 1. Tests/services/EconomyServiceTests.cs
> 2. Tests/menu/ForecastMenuTests.cs
> 
> Once you add these files, I'll be able to provide the proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to fix the errors.

> I'll fix the errors in the test files by updating the ItemModel constructor calls. The main issue is that ItemModel now requires an objectId parameter in its constructor, but the tests are trying to set it as a property.

**Verdict:** ✅ It didn't get every single instance on this first attempt but the work it did was exactly what I wanted. There's a chance resharper has a way to do this too, but this was just *easier*

**Verdict:** ✅ With that, an annoying refactor became trivial

## Conclusion

This was a clear win for the ai. Saved me quite a bit of time and headache! An incredibly useful tool even if this is the only type of problem I use it for (and as we've seen I don't think that will be the case)
