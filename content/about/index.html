        <p>I'm Paul Steele, a software engineer based out of the Indianapolis area.</p>
        <p>I'm currently interested in automation of all kinds, whether that be continuous integration pipelines, or home automation. At the moment that involves interacting a lot with Kubernetes, and cloud automation.</p>
        <p>Here I'll post the various thoughts that come to me from time to time, some related to technology and some just about life in general.</p>
